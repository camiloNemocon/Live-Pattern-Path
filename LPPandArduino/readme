Proyect realeased in Processing to create pattern sounds using visual controls to generate musical sets using arduino to generate sound with output devices (motors, solenoids and other actuators)

To change the sounds, you need to replace the .mp3 sound files in data folder. The name of the mp3 files will be the same as original mp3 files.

To run the proyect, connect Arduino and Open FirmataLPP.ino program in the FirmataLPP folder. Next, load program in Arduino Board.
   
Go to executable folder and open the folder of your operative system and click on LivePatternPathArduino program.

To run the proyect in Processing you need to follow the next steps:

    Open Processing
    Install ControlP5 library, to do this, in Processing you need go Skecth -> import library -> Add to library In filter -> ControlP5 -> install
    Install Minim Audio library, to do this, in Processing you need go Skecth -> import library -> Add to library In filter -> Minim -> install
    Install the library Arduino (FIRMATA) in Processing, to do this, in Processing you need go Skecth -> import library -> Add to library In filter -> Arduino (FIRMATA)  -> install
	Close Processing
    Move LPPsets folder to Processing Folder
	
	In Arduino Board, connect output devices in are conected in pin: pin 2,4,7,8,12 or Analogs Pin, never in PWM pins.
	
    Open LivePatternPathArduino.pde Processing File
    Run project.
